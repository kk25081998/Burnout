Immediate things to do:
~~1. Add company model to store company names, id, description, sector, size (number of employees) etc... (DONE)~~
~~2. Each user should be linked to a company id, so add that in the user model and in the registration HTML (DONE)~~
~~3. Create a questionnaire based on the MBIT test for burnout (this should be in the forms.py)~~
~~4. Edit user profile page so the user can change their usernames, password, and image potentially, add name first and last as well, date of birth~~
~~5. Create a history page as well for the user to see past results of the questionnaire~~

Long-term to-do list:
6. Implement role systems so different roles see different pages
7. Managers can view other subordinate results on a separate tab/page
8. Work on building a more resilient logic of burnout
9. Figure out how to sign in using Google email or Microsoft email and that sort of workflow
